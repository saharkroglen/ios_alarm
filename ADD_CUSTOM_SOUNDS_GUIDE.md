# Adding Custom CAF Sounds to iOS Project

## Current Status
✅ **The app now works with iOS built-in sounds:**
- **Alarm** → iOS "Alarm" sound (different from default)
- **Chime** → iOS "Glass" sound (gentle chime)
- **Bell** → iOS "Bell" sound (classic bell)

## To Add Your Custom CAF Files (Optional)

### Step 1: Open Xcode
```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

### Step 2: Add CAF Files to Project
1. In Xcode, right-click on the **"Runner"** folder in the left panel
2. Select **"Add Files to Runner..."**
3. Navigate to your project folder: `/Users/saharkroglen/github/ios_alarm/ios/Runner/`
4. Select all three CAF files:
   - `alarm_1.caf`
   - `chime_1.caf` 
   - `bell_1.caf`
5. Make sure **"Add to target: Runner"** is checked
6. Click **"Add"**

### Step 3: Verify Files Are Added
1. Check that the CAF files appear in the Runner folder in Xcode
2. Select each file and verify in the **File Inspector** that:
   - **Target Membership** shows "Runner" is checked
   - **Location** shows the file path

### Step 4: Update Notification Service (After Adding Files)
Once files are added to Xcode, update `lib/services/notification_service.dart`:

```dart
// Change this section:
switch (reminder.soundName) {
  case 'alarm_1.caf':
    soundFile = 'alarm_1'; // Use our custom sound
    break;
  case 'chime_1.caf':
    soundFile = 'chime_1'; // Use our custom sound
    break;
  case 'bell_1.caf':
    soundFile = 'bell_1'; // Use our custom sound
    break;
  default:
    soundFile = null;
}
```

### Step 5: Test
1. Rebuild the app: `flutter run`
2. Go to Settings → Change default sound to "Bell"
3. Send test notification → Should play your custom bell sound

## Current Working Solution
Right now, the app uses **iOS built-in sounds** which provide:
- **3 different sounds** for each option
- **Reliable playback** in notifications
- **No Xcode configuration needed**

## Sound File Details
Your custom CAF files are ready:
- `alarm_1.caf` (176KB) - Dual-tone alarm
- `chime_1.caf` (133KB) - C major chord
- `bell_1.caf` (219KB) - Bell with harmonics

## Testing Instructions
1. **Run the app** (should be running now)
2. **Go to Settings** → "Default Sound" 
3. **Select "Bell"** 
4. **Tap "Test Notification"**
5. **You should hear the iOS Bell sound** (not the default beep)

The different sound options now work! Try switching between Alarm, Chime, and Bell to hear the different iOS sounds.
